# Simple Calculator

A basic web-based calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allows users to perform fundamental arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus through a simple and intuitive interface.
## Features

- Supports basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and modulus (%).
- Clear button (C) to reset the display.
- Responsive design for use on various screen sizes.
- User-friendly interface with a dark theme and hover effects on buttons.
-Error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., division by zero).

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Structures the calculator's user interface.
- CSS: Styles the layout, display, and buttons for a clean and modern look.
- JavaScript: Implements the calculator's logic, including button interactions and expression evaluation.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
- No additional software or dependencies are required.

## Installation

### Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/kesavanaswin/Simple-Calculator.git
```

### Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd Simple-Calculator
```

### Open index.html in a web browser to use the calculator.

## Usage

- Click the number buttons (0-9) to input digits.
- Use the operator buttons (+, -, *, /, %) to build expressions.
- Press the equals button (=) to evaluate the expression.
- Use the clear button (C) to reset the display.

## Project Structure

- index.html: Contains the HTML structure for the calculator's interface.
- style.css: Defines the styling for the calculator, including layout and button design.
- script.js: Handles the logic for button clicks, expression evaluation, and error handling.

## Limitations

- Uses JavaScript's eval() function for expression evaluation, which is suitable for this simple application but not recommended for handling untrusted inputs in production environments.
- Limited to basic arithmetic operations; no support for advanced functions like square roots or memory storage.
